Heyo! 
Thank you for purchasing Tiny Wonder Swamp Asset Pack! :D

Here are a few guidelines for slicing and animating the characters included in the pack:

Frog:
- Frog npc is 24px tall and 32px wide
- You can prolong the first frame of the idle animation however you would like to create a smoother idle animation

Main Character:
- Idle and walking animations are 24x by 24px
- Fishing animations are 44px tall and 50px wide
- You can prolong the fishing animation by extending or multiplying the frames with bait in the water


Hope you enjoy the pack and look forward for more updates!
